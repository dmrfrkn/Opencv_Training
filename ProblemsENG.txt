1. Loading and Displaying the Image
Load an image with OpenCV and show it on the screen.
Close the image when the user presses a key.

2. Convert Image to Grayscale
Convert a color image to grayscale and show both color and grayscale images side by side.

3. Show Video Source
Receive the image from the webcam and display it on the screen in real time.
Stop the image when the user presses a key.

4. Save Image
Load an image, apply an operation (e.g. grayscale) to it and save the result to a file.

5. Draw Geometric Shapes
Create a blank image (for example, a black background) and overlay it:
Line
Rectangle
Apartment
Add text.

6. Mirror in Live View
Mirror the image from the webcam horizontally (mirror effect) and display it on the screen.

7. Simple Edge Detection
Apply the Canny edge detection algorithm on an image and show the edges.

8. Thresholding Process
Convert an image to grayscale and apply different thresholding methods:
Fixed thresholding (cv2.threshold).
Adaptive thresholding (cv2.adaptiveThreshold).

9. Color Extraction
Filter a user selected color (for example, red) from the image and show only that color.
You can do this with the cv2.inRange function.

10. Resize the Image
Scale an image to different sizes (for example, 50% reduction, 200% enlargement).
Show the image in a window.

11. Rotate an Image
Rotate an image by a certain degree (for example, 90° or 45°) and show the result.
